# Threshold fertility for the avoidance of extinction under critical conditions

## The extinction probability P and the critical fertility rate b_(cr)

"sept19_Fig1" generates Figure 1 in the manuscript of the study. 

Figure 1 shows the dependence of the extinction probability P to the different parameters: fertility rate, sex-ratio and mortality rates.


## The population with subcritical fertility goes extinct except for a few exceptions that keep growing

"sept19_Fig2" generates Figure 2 in the manuscript of the study.

Figure 2 shows the dynamics of the population starting with a single female in generation 0 with subcritical fertility rates.

## The ratio of extinct populations is plotted against generation number

"sept19_Fig3" generates Figure 3 in the manuscript of the study.

Figure 3 shows the ratio of extinction population per generation.

## The histogram of survived generations for the population with subcritical fertility

"sept19_Fig4" generates Figure 4 in the manuscript of the study.

Figure 4 shows shows histogram of the number of generations lived of population.
